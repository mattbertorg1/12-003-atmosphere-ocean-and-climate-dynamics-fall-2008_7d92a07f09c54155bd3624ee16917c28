The rotation rate of our table can be quoted in various units. The following are often used - period, revolutions per minute, or units of 'f', as described below:

1.  The angular velocity of the tank, Ω , in radians per second
    
2.  The Coriolis parameter (f) defined as f = 2Ω
    
3.  The period of one revolution of the tank, τ, in seconds is τ = 2π/Ω
    
4.  Revolutions per minute, rpm = 60/τ
    

**Conversion table**

|  Ω (rad/s) | 0 | 0.25 | 0.5 | 1 | 1.5 | 2 |
|  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} f=2Ω(rad/s) {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  | 0 | 0.5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| τ(s) | ∞ | 8π = 25. 1 | 4π = 12. 6 | 2π = 6. 3 | 4π/3 = 4. 2 | π = 3.14 |
| rpm | 0 | 2\. 4 | 4\. 7 | 9.5 | 14.3 | 19.1 

Note that on the 'big' table pictured above, the digital readout is the rotation rate in &grave;milli-f': thus 1000 is a rotation rate of 1× f: the period of rotation is thus 12.6 s.
